          <div><p>
            Born and raised in Los Angeles, CA, Lokyee has always enjoyed art, but never called herself an artist. She began playing piano at 7, guitar at 10, joined her first choir at 13, and sang in various choral settings including show choir, acapella. While her early illustrations mostly involved doodles, she began drawing and painting after she moved to Eugene, OR for her graduate degree. Finding illustration as a release from the stress of graduate school, and being in the evergreen Pacific Northwest, she combined the two and began drawing the natural environment around her. Discovering a particular love for wildflowers, Lokyee began her self-taught artist journey by identifying and drawing wildflowers found around the city and beyond. While exploring different forms of illustration, she also began experimenting with digital photography after inheriting a Canon camera from a friend. While wildflowers are a staple in her photography, she's since expanded her work to include friends, family, and her tripod dog, Thumper. 
            Today Lokyee lives in Portland with her partner and their three-legged dog. She pays rent by working as a Communications Coordinator at a local non-profit racial justice organization.
